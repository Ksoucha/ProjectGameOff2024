# GameOff2024 - SteamBound

## Game Overview
Developed with Unreal Engine 5, in 3D, where you can alternate between first-person and top-down view. In collaboration with 9 people listed here https://doumeki21.itch.io/steambound

The game is set in a village occupied by villagers and villains. As you enter it, you are free to explore it until you stumble across villains that will attack you. To fight back, you have a wide range of options: 4 kinds of spells that you can customize by changing their speed, their scale and their shape. Since you begin with only a few of these spells, you will need to explore the village to find books that will allow you to acquire more spells. As you will cast the spells, you will notice that some spells are more effective against some other spells, and that some spells even have health regeneration properties. Be careful not to drain all of your magic stamina while fighting, otherwise you will have to wait before casting the spells again. There are multiple missions that will show up when you enter a certain village area, and you might succeed or fail these missions. All of the villagers in the game can be interacted with, and some of them will also help you defeat enemies. However, not all of them know how to fight properly. This is why you can use the top-down mode, which can help you defeat the enemies by leading/controlling your allies in combat. The end of the game can be triggered in 2 different ways, and the game end screen will show you which missions were succeeded.
